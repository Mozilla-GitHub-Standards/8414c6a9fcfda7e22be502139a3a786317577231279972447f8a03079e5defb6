# MISSION
**We work to make research collaborative, accessible, and usable.**

We do this by:
* Empowering the next generation of leaders through fellowships and mentorship;
* Facilitating project-based learning around open data and open source;
* And supporting and advocating for a growing community of researchers working openly.

#### MISSION ACCOMPLISHED
**We are done when working openly and collaboratively, data sharing and reuse, and research communication are integral to research practice and a self-sustaining network of people working openly grows and expands into the future.**

#### TARGET AREAS AND OUTCOMES

##### Research Practice
*Community Members:* Students, Researchers, Software developers, Citizen Scientists, Science Non-Profits, Governmental Research Organizations

1. Open practices are acknowledged through the tenure & promotion process
* Best practices are identified, tested and accepted.
* Open research materials are linked to more publications and are cited.
* Research organizations have methods to recognize and reward working open practices.

2. Collaboration is simple to do across organizational, geographic and disciplinary boundaries
* Tools exist that facilitate research collaboration
* Researchers and software developers are encouraged and rewarded for the building and use of these tools.

##### Training
*Community Members:* Faculty, Instructors, Textbook Publishers, Study Group & Project Leads, TAs

1. Collaboration and open practice are taught as part of "how to do science" at undergraduate and graduate levels.
* Educational materials exist for different expertise levelsand are widely known and accessible to curriculum planners.
* Champions have been mentored and practiced working open in research and are ready to bring this knowledge to the classroom.

##### Policy, Tool & Service Development
*Community Members:* Librarians, Software Developers, University Administrators, Data Managers, Research Groups, Tool Developers, Project Leads

1. Community members in this area are aware of the benefit of open practice and feel empowered to and actively engage in conversations on how to support that work.
2. New tools and services are developed toward making best practices of open research easier to achieve and integrate into daily research.

##### Communication & Engagement
*Community Members:* Science Writers, Artists, Museums, Citizen Scientists, Publishers, Open Science Advocacy Groups, Researchers

1. Science communicators have good access to research and research producers.
2. Researchers and the public understand the value in sharing research openly.
3. Open advocacy groups have a clear sense as to where they can direct others to get involved.

##### Advocacy
*Community Members:* Publishers, Policy Makers, Funders, Open Science Advocacy Groups, Rock Star Researchers, Tech Companies

1. Those making policy decisions about access and reuse of content, data, and code are well informed by those doing the research.
2. Policy and advocacy is matched with on the ground action and enforcement.
3. Publishers see open access, not exclusivity, as the core of their business model.
