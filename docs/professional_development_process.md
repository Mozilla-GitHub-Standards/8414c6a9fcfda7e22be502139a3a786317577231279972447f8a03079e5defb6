<em>Updated: Jan 7, 2017</em>

#How to file a request:#

(1) Take your best go at the questions below, and send to your manager (Steph, in this case).

    What is the development opportunity?:

    What is the benefit for the individual/for the organization?:

    How will the employee share their learning with the team/organization?:

    What is the cost and how will this be funded? (include travel, lodging etc):

    What is the time commitment required?:


(2) Discuss with your manager any potential schedule conflicts, questions or comments that may have arisen from your answers.

(3) Your manager will then submit to the Director of HR (Michael Aukland).

(4) Awaiting final confirmation, you're all set. :)
